            Visuals by Jorge Jaramillo and Carlo Guillot (2012) 
            <br><br> 
            Mixed in Reaper, breathing/dialogue voiced and recorded by me, some sound effects sourced from Soundsnap and Freesound and reworked in Audacity. Soundtracks sourced from Freesound.
            <br><br>
            This absolutely stunning animated short by Jorge Jaramillo and Carlo Guillot is a crimson and bloody rendition of the popular fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood. Unlike the original European tale, this version of Little Red Riding Hood is certainly not child-friendly.
            <br><br>
            Opening with a silhouetted figure (the young heroine) skipping through a green forest, the clip soon shows she’s being stalked by the big bad wolf. Instead of the ensuing game of “my what big teeth you have,” Jorge Jaramillo and Carlo Guillot have the two engage in an epic, gladiator-esque duel.

            Drawn To You is an animated short by Eleanor Davitt. I removed the original audio and used the video to showcase my foley design. All sound effects and music shown were produced and edited by me. The whole project was mixed in Reaper and sounds were recorded using a Zoom H4N Pro recorder. <br><br>
            Using paper for foley design was a fun and interesting tool to create sounds for these characters and bring these scenes to life. The crinkling, rustling, and tearing of paper can all be manipulated to create unique auditory experiences. The animation focused on drawings coming to life, so paper was an ideal medium for the tactile, organic sounds of movement and transformation, adding depth and realism to the overall soundscape.

            Music composed by me, sound effects sourced from Freesound and Soundsnap and some are recorded using a Zoom H4n recorder. Mixed in Reaper. 
            <br><br>
            This video was created with AI based on the soundscape I created. My soundtrack is meant to be angelic but also haunting, giving a sense of the holy or sacred, but also an eerie and discomforting ambience. The combination of the ethereal and unsettling sounds creates a sense of wonder and fear, as though the viewer has stumbled upon a realm that is both enchanting and profoundly alien.

            This was a sample pitch for an ambient sound project, this is more fast-paced than the final product, but the idea is a soundscape that transport listeners to a forest/beach oasis. Sound effects sourced ethically and are free-use, composed by me. Mixed in Reaper.
